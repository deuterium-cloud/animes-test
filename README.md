# Small project for playing with four Testing libraries 

* Datafaker
* PODAM
* EasyRandom
* ArchUnit

---

### Datafaker
This is library for producing test data in wide variety of areas: names, addresses, emails, witchers...
The uses were demonstrates in datafaker folder in the tests.

### PODAM (POjo DAta Mocker)
The main usage of library is to fill given pojo with all possible attributes with random data. 
This behaviour can be customised. The usage was demonstrated in podam folder in the tests.

### EasyRandom
Similar as PODAM, maybe a bit easier to use.

### ArchUnit
ArchUnit is a simple and extensible library for checking the architecture of Java project.
ArchUnit can check dependencies between packages and classes, layers and slices, check for cyclic dependencies and more. 
The usage was demonstrated in archunit folder in the tests.
